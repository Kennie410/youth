    <div class="program-item">
        <h2>International Human Rights Day | 10 December</h2>
        <p>
            Every young person deserves dignity, opportunity, and a voice.
            At <strong>Youth With Vision Malawi</strong>, we stand for rights through action
            by empowering youth with skills, leadership, and pathways to decent livelihoods
            so no one is left behind.
        </p>
        <p>
            Human rights are not just words. They are jobs, justice, inclusion, and hope
            for young people today. When youth are empowered, rights are protected.
        </p>
        <p>
            This day also marked the conclusion of the <strong>16 Days of Activism against
            Gender-Based Violence</strong>. Our message was clear: inclusive communities
            begin when technical skills work for all young people—especially young women
            and marginalized youth.
