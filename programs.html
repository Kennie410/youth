            Every young person deserves dignity, opportunity, and a voice.
            At <strong>Youth With Vision Malawi</strong>, we stand for rights through action
            by empowering youth with skills, leadership, and pathways to decent livelihoods
            so no one is left behind.
        </p>
        <p>
            Human rights are not just words. They are jobs, justice, inclusion, and hope
            for young people today. When youth are empowered, rights are protected.
        </p>
        <p>
            This day also marked the conclusion of the <strong>16 Days of Activism against
            Gender-Based Violence</strong>. Our message was clear: inclusive communities
            begin when technical skills work for all young people—especially young women
            and marginalized youth.

        Today we joined <strong>Karonga District Council</strong> in the joint launch of the
        <strong>16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence</strong> campaign.
    </p>

    <p>
        The launch brought together various stakeholders to unite efforts in ending all forms
        of Gender-Based Violence, with particular attention to the rising cases of violence
        through digital platforms.
    </p>

    <p>
        Youth With Vision was represented by <strong>Tisungane Mpina</strong> and
        <strong>Monica Mulwafu</strong>, who are also leading a campaign focused on ending
        violence against young women by equipping them with technical and vocational skills.
        We recognize empowerment as a pathway to safety, dignity, and independence.
